    That is my Final Paper code for the industrial automation in technical course.

    He was carried out at the ETEC institution together with my colleagues Manuella Bortoleto, Yury Luiz de Camargo and Gabriel Alcides Pagoto.

    This work hasn't yet been published, but when it is, i will add a link to access the official website with complete documentation.

# what is project

    This project are a automatic medicine dispenser.
 
    It was developed on an Arduino Uno, being the name of code "proj_final_X".

your goal is:
------
* be cheaper than the competition;
* be accessible to seniors and their caregivers;
* adapt for the [third goal United Nations](https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal3).

## code development considerations
    that is mine first serious code, so he might have some problems, especially with optimization. However, i learned a lot from him.

    If I changed the code, I would optimize it and integrate it into an IOT.
